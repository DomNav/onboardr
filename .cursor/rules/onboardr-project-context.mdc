You are contributing to a project called **Onboardr** ‚Äî a real-time Web3 DeFi analytics dashboard inspired by traditional stock market UIs. Its purpose is to help users track DeFi protocols and opportunities with a familiar, intuitive experience.

üß† **Why We‚Äôre Building This:**
- Most DeFi dashboards are too complex or intimidating for non-crypto-native users.
- We're making it easier to **onboard traditional investors** into Web3 by mirroring clean, familiar financial dashboards.
- It also acts as a visual wrapper to eventually integrate **smart wallet tooling**, **automation flows**, and **real DeFi API data**.

üéØ **Core Goals:**
1. Display real-time data from protocols like Soroswap and Defindex
2. Replace stocks (AAPL/MSFT) with token pools (e.g. SORO/USDC, DFX/USDT)
3. Show metrics like:
   - Total Value Locked (TVL)
   - APR / APY
   - 24h Volume
   - Token price charts
   - Pool performance over time
4. Add contextual insights using AI agents later
5. Prioritize **security**, **auditing**, and **clean code** for production readiness

üß± **Current Stack:**
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- Recharts (for data visualization)
- Mock APIs with intent to plug into live data from:
   - The Graph
   - Defindex API
   - Soroswap subgraph
- Zod + React Hook Form
- Cursor (for AI-driven code generation and refactoring)

üîê **Security Goals:**
- Maintain strong type safety and predictable state
- Use security-first API patterns
- Plan for future integration with wallet providers and permissioned endpoints

üí° **Vision:**
This project is both a frontend showcase and a launchpad for smart agents that:
- Suggest DeFi strategies
- Summarize performance
- Automate pool interactions
