description: Scaffold secure, composable backend API handlers for wallet interactions (balance, tx, auth).
alwaysApply: false

- All endpoints must validate inputs using Zod or equivalent schema
- Use environment variables for private keys or signing secrets
- Avoid hardcoding contract addresses â€” use a config module
- Group endpoints under `/api/wallets/` with clear REST semantics
- Log all signing requests with metadata, but exclude PII
- Return human-readable and machine-readable responses
- Use retry and timeout wrappers around contract calls
