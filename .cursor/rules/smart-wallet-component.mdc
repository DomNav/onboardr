description: Enforces best practices for building modular, secure, and composable smart wallet UI components.
- Prefer component composition and separation of concerns
- Use Tailwind and shadcn/ui for consistent styling
- Wallet UI components must include props for connection state, user address, and error fallback
- Always abstract wallet providers into a shared context (e.g., useWallet.ts)
- Use optimistic UI for balance + transaction status updates
- Ensure all user inputs are validated before calling any signer methods
