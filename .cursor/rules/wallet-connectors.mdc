description: Provides a consistent architecture for plugging in wallet connectors (Freighter, Albedo, etc).
alwaysApply: false
---
- Encapsulate each wallet type as a connector module (e.g., freighter.ts)
- Expose unified `connect()`, `disconnect()`, `getAccount()`, `signTx()` API
- Maintain connector state using Zustand or React Context
- Fallback to guest view when no wallet is connected
- Emit events for wallet status changes (connected/disconnected/network)
